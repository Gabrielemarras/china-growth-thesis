# China is No Longer an Emerging Country – Master’s Thesis

This repository contains the final version of my Master’s thesis in Finance, submitted at Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore (Milan).  
The research focuses on China’s long-term growth potential and the effectiveness of its **Dual Circulation Strategy**, using a macroeconomic growth framework supported by econometric and forecasting techniques.

## Abstract

The thesis evaluates the sustainability of China’s economic development through an extended Solow growth model.  
It combines empirical calibration with econometric forecasting (ARDL) and Monte Carlo simulations to assess key growth drivers under multiple scenarios.

## Methodological Approach

- Solow growth model
- Econometric forecast (ARDL model)
- Scenario simulations (bootstrap)
- LaTeX typesetting for full academic formatting
